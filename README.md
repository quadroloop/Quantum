> A browser based game controller web application built with JavaScript+socket.io+NodeJS

- This is my a project for my 20th birthday, so i figure i might just have to build something fun :)
  the premise of this project is to build a browser based controller that connects to a computer via
  WiFi, and controls games by sendking keycodes over websockets, and having a it trigger a keypress on
  the computer.
